# Linear Algebra in Python with NumPy

This project covers key concepts in linear algebra using Python's NumPy library. The tasks include working with vectors, matrices, transpose, dot products, matrix multiplication, and broadcasting. Each concept is implemented in Python, and NumPy functions are used to perform efficient numerical operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- NumPy 1.15
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (or similar Linux distribution)
- Pycodestyle 2.5 (for code style checking)

## Installation

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.5 and NumPy 1.15 if they are not already installed:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3.5
    pip install numpy==1.15
    pip install pycodestyle==2.5
    ```

2. Ensure all files are executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x 0-slice_me_up.py  
    ```

## Running the Scripts

Each Python script can be executed from the command line using Python 3.5:

```bash
./0-slice_me_up.py  
```
OR [For Windows PowerShell]

```bash
python 0-slice_me_up.py
```

## Counting the lines in a file

```bash
wc -l 0-slice_me_up.py
```
OR [For Windows PowerShell]

```bash
(Get-Content .\0-slice_me_up.py).Count
```
