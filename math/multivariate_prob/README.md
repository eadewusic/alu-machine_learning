# Multivariate Probability Project

This project explores key concepts in multivariate probability, including joint probability distributions, covariance, correlation coefficients, and multivariate Gaussian distributions. It implements functions using NumPy to perform calculations related to these concepts, providing a foundational understanding for anyone studying statistics or data science.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- **Carl Friedrich Gauss**: Contributions to statistics and the normal distribution.
- **Joint/Multivariate Distribution**: The probability distribution of multiple random variables.
- **Covariance**: A measure of how two random variables change together.
- **Correlation Coefficient**: A normalized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
- **Covariance Matrix**: A matrix containing covariances between pairs of variables.
- **Multivariate Gaussian Distribution**: A generalization of the normal distribution to multiple variables.

## Requirements

This project requires the following:

- Python 3.5 or higher
- NumPy version 1.15
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for execution
