# Convolutions and Pooling

## Overview

This project implements essential concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), focusing on convolutions and pooling operations. The main goal is to understand and apply the mathematical principles behind these processes, using Python and NumPy.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- What is a convolution?
- What is max pooling and average pooling?
- What is a kernel/filter?
- What is padding?
- What is “same” padding and “valid” padding?
- What is a stride?
- What are channels?
- How to perform a convolution over an image.
- How to perform max/average pooling over an image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- NumPy 1.15
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eadewusic/alu-machine_learning.git
   cd math
   cd convolutions_and_pooling
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.5 and NumPy installed:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3
   pip install numpy==1.15
   ```

## Documentation

All modules, classes, and functions are documented using Python docstrings. You can view the documentation directly in the code or run:

```bash
python3 -c 'import convolution; print(convolution.__doc__)'
```
