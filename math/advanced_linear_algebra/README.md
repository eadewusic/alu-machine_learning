# Advanced Linear Algebra - Project

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing advanced linear algebra concepts using Python. Key topics include determinants, minors, cofactors, adjugate matrices, matrix inverses, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix definiteness. The aim is to understand and apply these concepts in practical scenarios using Python, adhering to specific requirements such as coding style, documentation, and execution guidelines.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Calculate the determinant of a matrix.
- Compute the minor, cofactor, and adjugate of a matrix.
- Find the inverse of a matrix using various methods.
- Understand and compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Determine the definiteness of a matrix (positive definite, semi-definite, indefinite).

## Project Requirements

- Python version: **Python 3.5**
- Libraries: **numpy (version 1.15)**
- Operating System: **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS**
- Style Guide: **pycodestyle (version 2.5)**
- Editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**

### Project Guidelines

- All Python files should start with the following line: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Your code must adhere to the **pycodestyle** style guide.
- Files must be executable (use `chmod +x filename.py` to ensure this).
- All functions and classes must be documented using Python docstrings.
- No additional Python modules are allowed unless specified.
- A `README.md` file is required for the project.
  
## Installation and Setup

1. Ensure you are working on **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS** with **Python 3.5** installed.
2. Install the required `numpy` version by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy==1.15
   ```
3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

4. Make sure all Python files are executable by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x filename.py
   ```

**Note: Refer to Linear Algebra Repo for making files executable on Windows**
