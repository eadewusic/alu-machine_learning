# Bayesian Probability Project

This project explores Bayesian probability and its applications using Python. The goal is to implement key concepts such as prior, likelihood, posterior, and Bayes' rule in a structured way. The code demonstrates how to update probabilities based on new evidence using Bayes' theorem.

## Key Concepts
- **Bayesian Probability**: A method of statistical inference that updates the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available.
- **Bayes' Theorem**: The foundational formula used to compute the posterior probability:
  
  P(A|B) = {P(B|A) * P(A)} / P(B)

- **Prior**: The initial probability of a hypothesis before new evidence is introduced.
- **Likelihood**: The probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
- **Posterior**: The updated probability of the hypothesis after considering the evidence.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.5 and `numpy` version 1.15 installed.
