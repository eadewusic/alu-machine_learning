# Calculus Project

## Overview

This project covers various topics in calculus, including summation and product notation, derivatives, integrals, and series. The primary goal is to understand and apply these fundamental concepts through multiple-choice questions and Python scripts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

- Summation and Product notation
- What a series is and common types of series
- Understanding of derivatives, including the product and chain rules
- Common derivative rules
- What partial derivatives are
- The concept of indefinite and definite integrals
- Understanding of double integrals

## Project Structure

```
├── README.md          # Project documentation
├── answer_file        # File containing answers to multiple choice questions
├── derivative.py      # Python script for calculating derivatives of polynomials
└── other_scripts.py   # Other Python scripts as needed
```

## Requirements

- The project files should be created and edited using the following editors:
  - `vi`
  - `vim`
  - `emacs`

- All Python scripts must begin with the shebang line:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  ```

- Follow the `pycodestyle` (PEP 8) for Python code formatting.

- Ensure all functions, classes, and modules are well-documented.
