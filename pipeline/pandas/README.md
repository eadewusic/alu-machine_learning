# Pandas Novice Project

## Project Overview
This project is designed to help you develop foundational skills in **Pandas**, a Python library for data manipulation and analysis. You will work with **Coinbase** and **Bitstamp** datasets to learn how to efficiently handle, analyze, and visualize data.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand what **Pandas** is and its importance in data analysis.
- Create and manipulate **pd.DataFrame** and **pd.Series**.
- Load data from CSV/Excel files into a DataFrame.
- Perform **indexing, slicing, and hierarchical indexing**.
- Modify DataFrame columns and reassign values.
- Sort, filter, and apply **Boolean logic** to a DataFrame.
- Merge, concatenate, and join multiple DataFrames.
- Extract **statistical insights** from data.
- Visualize data using Pandas built-in plotting functions.

## Installation & Setup
To ensure compatibility with the required versions, install **Pandas 0.24.x**:
```bash
pip install --user pandas==0.24.2
```
This project will be executed on **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS** using **Python 3.5**, with the following dependencies:
- **Numpy (1.15)**
- **Pandas (0.24.x)**


## Code Style & Documentation
- Follow **Pycodestyle (v2.4)** for formatting.
- Add docstrings for modules, classes, and functions:
```python
"""This module loads and preprocesses the dataset."""
```
- Ensure all files end with a new line.
