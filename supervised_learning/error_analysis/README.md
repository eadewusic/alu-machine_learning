# Error Analysis Master

## Project Overview
This project focuses on key concepts of error analysis in machine learning, including confusion matrices, performance metrics, and the bias-variance tradeoff. It aims to provide a solid understanding of evaluating and improving machine learning models through error analysis techniques.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand and create a **confusion matrix**.
- Define **Type I** and **Type II errors**.
- Explain **sensitivity (recall)**, **specificity**, **precision**, and **F1 score**.
- Calculate **bias** and **variance** in machine learning models.
- Understand the concept of **Bayes error** and how to approximate it.
- Apply error analysis techniques to improve machine learning models.

## Requirements
- All code must be written in **Python 3.5** and executed on **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS**.
- The only allowed external library is **NumPy (version 1.15)**.
- Code must follow **Pycodestyle (version 2.4)**.
- Each script must start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All functions, classes, and modules must include documentation.
- A `README.md` file (this file) is mandatory.
- All files must be executable and end with a new line.
