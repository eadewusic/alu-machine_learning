# Neural Style Transfer

This project implements **Neural Style Transfer (NST)**, a technique that blends the **content of one image** with the **style of another** to create a visually appealing new image. Inspired by the work of Gatys et al., the implementation uses **TensorFlow (v1.12)** with **Eager Execution** and a pre-trained **VGG19** model to optimize a generated image that matches the content of the input image and the style of a reference painting.
