# Regularization Techniques in Deep Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and use of regularization techniques in deep learning models to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization. The following techniques are covered:
- L1 Regularization
- L2 Regularization
- Dropout
- Early Stopping
- Data Augmentation

The techniques are implemented in **TensorFlow** and **Numpy**, with a focus on the mathematical principles behind each method and their implementation in a deep learning pipeline.

## Regularization Techniques

### L1 Regularization
L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the weights. This encourages sparsity in the model's weights, effectively leading to fewer non-zero weights.

Implementation Example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def l1_regularization_loss(weights, lambda_param):
    return lambda_param * tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(weights))
```

### L2 Regularization
L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the weights. This technique helps in shrinking the weights towards zero without forcing them to become exactly zero.

Implementation Example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def l2_regularization_loss(weights, lambda_param):
    return lambda_param * tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(weights))
```

### Dropout
Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training to prevent overfitting. The dropout rate determines the probability of a neuron being dropped out.

Implementation Example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def apply_dropout(layer, dropout_rate):
    return tf.layers.dropout(layer, rate=dropout_rate)
```

### Early Stopping
Early stopping halts the training process if the modelâ€™s performance on the validation set stops improving, preventing overfitting and saving computational resources.

### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation artificially increases the size of your training dataset by applying transformations like flipping, rotation, and scaling to the images.
